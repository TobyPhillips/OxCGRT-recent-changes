The Northern Territory According to a press release on the Northern
Territory Government Covid-19 website, on the 27th June the Northern
Territory “Security and Emergency Management Committee made the decision
under the Northern Territory pandemic plan to lock down part of the NT
community. Effective from 1.00pm today – the Darwin, Palmerston and
Darwin rural areas will enter a full lockdown for 48 hours. That means
the local government areas of the City of Darwin, the City of
Palmerston, and Litchfield. This follows confirmation of four new
covid-19 positive cases all linked to the Tanami case.” “All businesses,
retail outlets, hospitality venues, gyms, pools and community centres
will be closed. Cafes and restaurants will be able to offer take-away
and delivery services.” Furthermore, it the NT COVID-19 government
website clearly states that only essential workers are able to leave
home in order to work. See archived URL for list of essential workers.
Northern territory workplace closures are more restrictive compared to
the New South Wales work place closures that came into effect on the
26th June 2021. Therefore changed to a 3T code.

a face mask (unless an exemption applies).”"

New South Wales In response to a growing cluster of community
transmission within Sydney the Premier of NSW announced stay at home
orders which came into effect on Saturday 26th June 2021. Residents of
Greater Sydney, including the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong
and Shellharbour (all in New South Wales) were ordered to stay at home,
unless they had one of the “reasonable excuses” to leave home. According
to the NSW government COVID-19 website the following are considered
reasonable excuses to leave home: “A reasonable excuse is if you need to
• obtain food or other goods and services o for the personal needs of
the household or for other household purposes (including pets) o for
vulnerable people o if the food or goods and services are not available
in the local government area that you live in • travel for work or
education if it is not possible to do it at home • exercise and take
outdoor recreation in Greater Sydney • go out for medical or caring
reasons, including obtaining a COVID-19 vaccination • donate blood •
access childcare • continue existing arrangements for access to, and
contact between, parents and children • attend a wedding or funeral •
provide care or assistance (including personal care) to a vulnerable
person or to provide emergency assistance • access social services,
employment services, services provided to victims (including as victims
of crime), domestic violence services, and mental health services • move
to a new place of residence, or between your different places of
residence • undertake legal obligations • avoid injury or illness or to
escape the risk of harm • in case of emergencies • for compassionate
reasons, including where two people are in a relationship but do not
necessarily live together • to provide pastoral care if you are a
priest, minister of religion or member of a religious order. Taking a
holiday is not a reasonable excuse.” This stay at home order is enforced
by the Public Health (COVID-19 Temporary Movement and Gathering
Restrictions) Order 2021 which came into effect from 26th June 2021.
Under the new Order, stay at home requirements have been extended to all
LGAs in the Greater Sydney area which includes the Blue Mountains,
Central Coast, Wollongong and Shellharbour. There are also additional
restrictions across NSW. The Order has commenced and will be in place
until midnight 9 July, unless extended or repealed earlier.

As of 28 june 2021, all provinces and territories are applying
government of Canada guidance that when individuals “test positive for
COVID-19, a public health official will ask you questions to collect
important information about your symptoms; activities and travel you did
before you tested positive; all the people you may have been in close
contact with while you were contagious …contact tracing. It’s a key
public health measure.” With daily case counts much lower than at peak
levels earlier in 2021 and recent isolated outbreaks subsiding, there is
no evidence in the past 10 days of contact tracing efforts failing to
keep up with new cases. See Government of Canada website, archived:

Moscow authorities reimposed work-from-home restrictions as the Russian
capital posted a new daily record for Covid-19 deaths due to a surging
outbreak of the Delta variant. In a decree published on his website,
Mayor Sergei Sobyanin ordered that businesses cut their number of
in-office workers by 30% from June 28. Vaccinated employees would be
excluded, the decree said, adding that all workers aged over 65 as well
as those with pre-existing conditions would have to work from home. From
June 28, all Moscow cafes and restaurants will only serve customers who
have been vaccinated; who have had Covid-19 in the past six months; or
who present a negative Covid-19 test taken within the past 78 hours.

June 28 marks the end of the June holidays and the beginning of a new
semester in the Singapore Academic calendar. Schools are gradually
re-opening, starting with some levels resuming in-person classes and
working towards all level returning to in-person classes by July 6. All
schools must continue to adhere to covid prevention guidelines (aka safe
management measures - SMMs).
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Quote (1): "“1. As
Singapore moves into Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) with gradual easing of
community safe management measures (SMMs), the Ministry of Education
(MOE) will progressively bring students back to school after the June
school holidays. The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will also
gradually increase the number of students allowed back on campus for
face-to-face learning. Schools and IHL campuses will continue to adhere
to SMMs to keep students and staff safe. 2. To ease into full resumption
of school when Term 3 begins on Monday, 28 June 2021, the following
arrangements have been made for students from primary and secondary
schools, junior colleges (JCs) and Millennia Institute (MI) for the
first week of school (please refer to the ANNEX for the illustrative
schedule for Week 1): - From Monday, 28 June 2021, Primary 4 to 6,
Secondary 3 to 5 and all JC/MI students will return to school. -
Secondary 1 and 2 students will be on Home-Based Learning (HBL) till
Wednesday, 30 June 2021, and will return to school from Thursday, 1 July
2021. - Primary 1 to 3 students will be on HBL for the first week, and
schools will continue to provide instructions and support for students
to access online and hardcopy HBL materials. 3. All levels of students
will return to school from Tuesday, 6 July 2021 onwards, as Monday, 5
July 2021 is a school holiday (Youth Day).”" Link (1):
