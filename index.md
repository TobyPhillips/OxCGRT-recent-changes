As published on the Victorian Government COVID-19 website on the 9th
June 2021 media release Victoria’s current restrictions were to be
further eased from 11.59pm Thursday 10 June. A statement from the Acting
Premier of Victoria, also published on 9th June 2021, stated that “In
good news for families, schools will be able to resume face-to-face
learning for all students from Friday \[11th June 2021\].” The Workplace
Directions (No 32) also came into effect on 11:59:00am on 12 June 2021.
Schools and higher education are open for in person teaching/learning.
Nonetheless, these directions, in part impose a density requirement of
one person per 4 square meters. This applies, to the
non-classroom/teaching spaces of child care services, schools, and
higher education institutions. “The density quotient does, however,
still apply to office areas including shared spaces that form part of an
office area, spaces such as lunchrooms, photocopier room, principal’s
office, back of reception and resource rooms. The density quotient also
applies to any publicly accessible areas (including in relation to a
school, non-school senior secondary providers, or childcare or early
childhood service, or higher education service), and any such publicly
accessible areas that are subject to the signage requirements under
subclause (20).” Therefore, changed to a 1T code.

As published on the Victorian Government COVID-19 website on the 9th
June 2021 media release Victoria’s current restrictions were to be
further eased from 11.59pm Thursday 10 June. A statement from the Acting
Premier of Victoria, also published on 9th June 2021, stated that “When
it comes to work, there’ll no longer be a list \[of approved
workers/workplaces\]– but if you can work from home, you should.”
However, the Restricted Activity Directions (Metropolitan Melbourne) (No
3) also came into effect on 11:59:00am on 12 June 2021. These directions
commence at 11:59:00pm on 10 June 2021 and end at 11:59:00pm on 17 June
2021. The direction requires the closing of a range of workplaces
include: “A person who owns, controls or operates a facility in
subclause (2)(g) (arcade), subclause (2)(h) (amusement park), subclause
(2)(i) (casino), (2)(k) (gaming machine area), subclause (2)(l)
(brothel, sex on premises venue or sexually explicit entertainment
venue), subclause (2)(m) (bingo centre), subclause (2)(n) (escape room),
subclause (2)(p) (karaoke facility) and subclause (2)(q) (nightclub)
must not operate the areas in those facilities that are accessible to
the public during the restricted activity period.” Furthermore, indoor
operation of non-ticketed and seated events in the following venues is
not allowed. In practice, these venues/workplaces are therefore also
closed: “A person who owns, controls or operates a facility in subclause
(2)(a) (theatre), (2)(b) (cinema except a drive-in cinema), (2)(c)
(music hall, concert hall or auditorium), (2)(d) (gallery or museum
except an outdoor gallery or museum), (2)(e) (State Library), (2)(f)
(arena or stadium), (2)(o) (animal facility except an outdoor animal
facility) or (2)(q) (convention centre)…” Melbourne has the most
restrictive COVID-19 restrictions on workplaces in Victoria and all of
Australia. However, in Melbourne, clearly non-essential workplaces are
now open for in person trade. This include: Café, restaurant, fast food
store, cafeteria, canteen, winery, food court (indoor and outdoor spaces
(according to the VIC government) COVID-19 webpage. Therefore, changed
to a 2T code.

hospitality venue can host up to 25 patrons before the density quotient
apply. Electronic record keeping must be used.” Retail: “Open with
COVIDSafe requirements: density quotient of one per two square metres.
Record keeping required where practical and electronic preferred.” Full
details available at links. Therefore, change to a 1T code.

departure for Iceland. In addition, arrivals must undergo a COVID-19
test at their point of entry and quarantine for five days before taking

who have been in these countries within the previous seven days. Those

designated hotel accommodation for 14 days on arrival at their own
expense. On 12 June Malawi introduced the following restrictions on
entry at all borders. A person who: is not a citizen of Malawi; does not
hold a resident permit for Malawi; does not have a permanent home or is
not ordinarily resident in Malawi; is not part of a team of medical
personnel that is required to provide medical services in Malawi; is not
a member of the diplomatic or consular staff of a country that is
accredited to Malawi or is in transit to another country; or is not a
spouse, shall be refused entry into Malawi. Exceptions are made for
members of an organisation intending to support, supporting or

Lessons at Moscow schools were not interrupted even during the pandemic.
They managed to establish a distance learning system in just one week in
March 2020. Lessons were held in such a way till the end of the academic
year. Schoolchildren without their own gadgets were provided with
laptops and tablets: over 18 thousand children received them. The main
training resource was Moscow Electronic School. This is an online
platform with over 53 thousand scripts of lessons for all classes and
all subjects, 1.7 thousand study guides, virtual labs, tests and
everything you need for the training process. All of the universities
reporting to the federal ministry (248) have transferred their
educational operations to an online format. Several online resources
have also been launched: a situation center and a hot line, a YouTube
channel for online broadcasts of meetings and workshops, a Telegram
channel @minobrnaukiofficial, and a website for universities (“Keep
learning, Keep teaching”) with methodological support. An online
platform established by the Agency of Strategic Initiatives, The
University 2035, provides additional methodological support to
universities.
